Helios 2400 is a strategy game set in the future Solar System on Mars: the Martian colony has declared independence from Earth and must assemble a legitimate global government before Earth can reassert its colonial authority. Lead your faction to lead the Martian people!

## Inspiration

Helios2400 is spirtually inspired by the diplomatic gameplay of the 1996 Holistic Design game ["Emperor of the Fading Suns"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_the_Fading_Suns), updated for the 21st century. The king-of-the-hill and diplomatic aspects married to a setting of where players are factions in a single nation are emphasized.


## Installation

- Download & Install [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/) for your platform.
- Checkout this repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Run with `love .` in the repository root. You may have to set up an alias in your terminal.
- run_dev.sh (included in the repo) will run tests and then the game, assuming love.app is installed in your applications folder (**Mac only script**)

## Testing

- Uses [Busted](http://olivinelabs.com/busted/) for unit testing
- Run tests with `busted spec/` after installing busted ([luarocks](https://luarocks.org/) recommended)

## Getting Started

There are a few places to consider consulting in order to begin collaborating on Helios 2400:

- The [Project Page](https://github.com/Sewerbird/Helios2400/projects) here on Github holds the currently planned roadmaps. Here you can see which issues are being worked on actively and which issues are prioritized.
- The [Issue Page](https://github.com/Sewerbird/Helios2400/issues) is full of stuff that can be worked on. Please submit an issue if you found a problem that has not been noted already. Suggestion issues are welcome too, but please tag them as such.
- The [Github Wiki](https://github.com/Sewerbird/Helios2400/wiki) serves as a container for general documentation, although (as tends to be the case), the source-code is the base truth.
- Feel free to stop by [my blog](https://sewerbird.github.io) to get recent State of the Game announcements. There should be a section dedicated to Helios 2400, or conspicuous postings.
- The [Game Design Document](https://github.com/Sewerbird/Helios2400/blob/master/Helios_GDDvB.md) tries to thoroughly document everything, from the perspectives of Gameplay, User Interface, and Implementation.

## Pull Request Process

The Helios2400 project accepts pull requests against the `master` branch.

I recommend writing your pull request summary and naming your branch following existing convention to keep things tidy:

- Branch names ideally follow the format `issue_##_briefdescription`
- Pull requests should have a descriptive name, link to the issue being addressed, a checklist of features/items to be implemented, and finally any additional notes.
- Pull requests are reviewed using the built-in Github code review process before being merged into master.

## Premium Plans

Although Helios2400 is open source software, there are plans to seek funding for its development and art assets. A premium version of Helios2400 with lovely art assets and expanded scenarios is in the works. The source-code and art assets shared on this repository, however, are covered by the permissive license listed at the bottom of this readme.
